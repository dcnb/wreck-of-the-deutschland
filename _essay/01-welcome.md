CB-Essay is a Jekyll-based framework that combines **long-form essay writing** with **digital collection features**. Built on CollectionBuilder, it enables you to create multimodal scholarly narratives that seamlessly integrate primary sources, archival materials, and multimedia items directly into your writing.

## What Makes CB-Essay Different?

Traditional digital publishing tools treat essays and collections as separate entities. CB-Essay unifies them, allowing you to:

- Write in **simple Markdown** with specialized features for scholarly work
- **Reference collection items** using simple includes
- Create **asides and margin notes** that link to primary sources
- Build **interactive timelines, maps, and visualizations** from your metadata
- Publish beautiful, accessible sites with **zero JavaScript complexity**

## How It Works

CB-Essay operates on a **dual-collection model**:

1. **Essay Collection** - Your narrative content lives in `_essay/` as Markdown files
2. **Object Collection** - Primary sources and items defined in a CSV metadata file

The magic happens when you combine them using specialized includes.
