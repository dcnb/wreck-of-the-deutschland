order: 3

CB-Essay provides specialized includes that extend Markdown for scholarly writing. This essay **demonstrates every feature** with working examples you can copy directly into your own work.

**The copy-and-replace principle:** Find a feature you like, copy the code block, paste it into your essay, and replace the content with yours. That's it!

## Blockquotes

Styled quotations with optional attribution and source links.

### Basic Blockquote

{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers"
   speaker="Alfred Lord Tennyson" %}

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers"
   speaker="Alfred Lord Tennyson" %}{% endraw %}
```

### With Source Citation

{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."
   speaker="Jane Austen"
   source="Pride and Prejudice" %}

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="Your quote text here"
   speaker="Author Name"
   source="Book or Article Title" %}{% endraw %}
```

### Large Centered Quote

{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="The only way out is through"
   size="xl"
   align="center" %}

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="Your dramatic quote"
   size="xl"
   align="center" %}{% endraw %}
```

**Size options:** `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`

**Align options:** `left`, `center`, `right`

---

## Asides (Margin Notes)

Margin notes appear beside your text on desktop, inline on mobile.

### Text-Only Aside

Here's a paragraph with a margin note.{% include essay/feature/aside.html text="This is a margin note providing additional context or commentary." %} The text continues naturally, and the aside appears in the margin.

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/aside.html
   text="Your margin note text here" %}{% endraw %}
```

### Aside with Collection Item

Collection items can appear in asides with thumbnails.{% include essay/feature/aside.html objectid="demo_001" text="This manuscript shows early draft revisions." %} The aside shows a preview of the item with a link to view it.

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/aside.html
   objectid="demo_001"
   text="Context about this item" %}{% endraw %}
```

**Note:** The `objectid` must exist in your collection metadata CSV file.

---

## Image Galleries

Display multiple collection items as inline galleries.

{% include essay/feature/image-gallery.html
   objectid="demo_001;demo_005;demo_012" %}

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/image-gallery.html
   objectid="item1;item2;item3" %}{% endraw %}
```

Separate multiple object IDs with semicolons. Items must exist in your metadata.

---

## Mini Maps

Embed small maps at specific coordinates.

{% include feature/mini-map.html
   latitude="46.727485"
   longitude="-117.014185"
   zoom="12" %}

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include feature/mini-map.html
   latitude="46.727485"
   longitude="-117.014185"
   zoom="12" %}{% endraw %}
```

**Finding coordinates:**
- Right-click location on Google Maps → Click coordinates to copy
- Or use [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/)

**Zoom levels:** 1 (world) to 18 (street level)

---

## Section Transitions

Create visual breaks between major sections using scrollama transitions.

{% include essay/new-section.html %}

## New Major Section

The section break above creates a visual pause and scroll-triggered transition effect. This helps structure long essays into distinct parts.

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include essay/new-section.html %}

## Your New Section Title

Content continues here...{% endraw %}
```

**Use sparingly** - 3-4 sections per essay maximum for best effect.

---

## CollectionBuilder Features

Beyond essay-specific includes, you can use any standard CollectionBuilder feature:

### Item Cards

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include feature/card.html
   objectid="demo_001"
   width="50"
   centered=true %}{% endraw %}
```

Shows a card with the item image and metadata.

### Item Images

**Copy this:**
```liquid
{% raw %}{% include feature/image.html
   objectid="demo_012"
   width="75" %}{% endraw %}
```

Displays an item image with caption from metadata.

### Timelines

For essays with chronological elements, embed the full timeline:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include feature/timeline.html %}{% endraw %}
```

### Subject Clouds

Visualize subject keywords from your collection:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include feature/cloud.html fields="subject" %}{% endraw %}
```

---

## Combining Features

You can combine multiple features for rich, scholarly presentations:

### Example: Blockquote + Aside + Map

{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately"
   speaker="Henry David Thoreau"
   source="Walden" %}

Thoreau's cabin was located on the shores of Walden Pond{% include essay/feature/aside.html text="The cabin measured 10 feet by 15 feet and cost $28.12 to build." %} in Concord, Massachusetts, where he lived from 1845 to 1847.

{% include feature/mini-map.html
   latitude="42.4407"
   longitude="-71.3428"
   zoom="14" %}

The location provided the solitude Thoreau sought for his philosophical experiment in simple living.
